## _Swag Labs - E2E Automated Testing_ 

Software developed for Swag Labs; with the purpose of adding value to our clients, offering them access to a virtual store with the best prices and quality in their products.

This automated testing aims to detect flaws in the developed software, avoiding that a person has to execute the tests manually, which means a decrease in test times, greater capacity for test execution and an increase in quality and reliability indicators.

For the Swap Labs project, automated tests were developed that include the entire user login flow, purchase, add and delete items, enter data for checkout, verify the links of published social networks, make a purchase without items and logout.

Additionally, we added the Allure Reports functionality, which allows us to visualize the results of the execution of an automated project in a clearer and more graphic way.

The users used for the tests are:

- standard_user
- locked_out_user
- problem_user
- performance_glitch_user
